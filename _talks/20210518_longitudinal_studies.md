<i>Longitudinal proteomic profiling of dialysis patients with COVID-19 reveals markers of severity and predictors of death.</i> Gave a talk on the longitudinal modelling approaches (linear mixed models and joint survival models) applied to an <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64827">Olink proteomics dataset</a>, generated from ESKD patients with COVID-19.
