I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/immunology-inflammation/">Department of Immunology and Inflammation</a> at Imperial College London. I am investigating multi-omics datasets to understand biology and developing tools to facilitate the interpretation of biological data.

My core project involves elucidating the role of genes and proteins in the context of inflammatory disease. I am currently combining genomic, transcriptomic and <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64827">proteomic</a> data to identify molecular pathways that play a driving role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

I am also interested in the <a href="/software/">processing and data-mining</a> of -omics datasets. I previously developed a pipeline for the <i>de novo</i> annotation of Pack-TYPE transposons based on sequence features, implemented as an R package which is <a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.packFinder">available</a> as part of the Bioconductor project. I am also involved in the development of <a href="https://github.com/computational-metabolomics/metaboblend"><i>MetaboBlend</i></a>, a Python package for the <i>de novo</i> structural elucidation of small molecules in mass spectrometry-based Metabolomics.
